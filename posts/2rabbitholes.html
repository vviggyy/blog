    <h1>2 Rabbit Holes </h1>
    <h4>8.13.25</h4>
    <p>I’ve been reading Dr. Richard Feynman’s book "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surely_You%27re_Joking,_Mr._Feynman!">Surely You’re Joking
    Mr. Feynman! Adventures of a Curious Character</a>". SYJMF!ACC for short, if
    you prefer.</p>
    <p>So far (I’m about halfway through), it’s been a charming and
    entertaining introduction to one of the world’s most interesting
    educators and physicists by the man himself. It manages to be readable
    and lighthearted too. I like to imagine his writing tone is how he’d
    converse with his colleagues as well, or at least mirrors some inner
    monologue playing while he engaged in his shenanigans.</p>
    <p>One SYJMF!ACC chapter stood out to me in particular. There was an
    entire chapter dedicated to a story about Feynman spending the evening
    observing ants in his office while he was a graduate student at
    Princeton. He recalls that he wanted to investigate how ants bring food
    back to their den, and whether they had a “sense of geometry”. He
    devises an experiment where he ferries them to and fro a sugar piece on
    using scraps of paper.</p>
    <p>The biggest takeaway I’m getting from this book is a demonstration of
    the power of curiosity. Clearly it’s gotten Feynman through MIT,
    Princeton, Los Alamos, and Cornell. Most of his success can be
    attributed to his words: “I always do that; get into something and see
    how far I can go”. The first part of that (getting into something) is
    what I want to discuss.</p>
    <p>Why have I never caught myself doing something like making paper
    ferries for ants? Is it because I don’t think the topic is “worth my
    time”? I spent sometime reflecting on whether this mindset is some
    subtle form of arrogance; to confine oneself to working on important
    problems, and not wasting my {precious, superior, illustrious} time. But
    who’s to say what’s important?</p>
    <p>This question’s been hotly debated for ages. The study of ants is
    surely worth nonzero utility. Ant colony dynamics could hold some
    insight for swarm robotics, or ant communication patterns could reveal
    something about information theory and compressible signals. People also
    clowned Dr. Ally Louks for her thesis until the Twitter algorithm’s
    invisible hand scooped many instances of practical use cases to the top
    of the feed.</p>
    <p>What bothers me is that I have explored rabbit holes before. I’ve
    spent afternoons learning the Rubik’s Cube, learning about wavefront
    aberration patterns (post coming soon!), making this site, etc. Indeed,
    I’ve committed myself to something that isn’t immediately useful but
    merely curiosity-satisfying. The frequency of this has decreased over
    time, perhaps because I view whatever my pressing responsibilities are
    as more important. Yet, I still find time to doomscroll. This is where
    the arrogance theory shines. It’s not that I don’t have the time, it
    must be that I think whatever I’m doing is more important. This is also
    no excuse. Feynman’s work was of utmost importance, yet he found the
    time to play with ants and attend tea time with the Dean.</p>
    <p>I am conflicted because this behavior, at first, seems to contradict
    Dr. Richard Hamming’s advice in his essay, You and Your Research. It’s
    such a fantastic essay, and I’d recommend that anyone interested in
    doing meaningful work should print a copy just to have. He says that
    great scientists focus on great problems, and should “drop everything”
    when they see the potential to solve one of the many such problems they
    have on standby. Which is it?</p>
    <p>Obviously there’s some nuance to the situation. Feynman didn’t spend
    ALL of his time running experience on ants, and rather spent most of his
    time doing intelligent physics. But, I guess the better question is:
    what benefit does Feynman see to this curiosity? Is it just for the
    purpose of cultivating a mindset? And what prevents me from “wasting
    time” in pursuit of rabbit holes?</p>
    <p>The answer I’ve arrived at is that it’s an issue of results not
    process. We tend to commit to obligations because of the perceived net
    gain of the results over the cost of committing. We never commit to
    things if the gain doesn’t at least offset the opportunity cost of
    completing the activity. Rabbit holes are touchy because it’s difficult
    to calculate the gain, and the cost is almost always large in terms of
    productivity. You never know what you may learn, if you find anything
    useful at all. The cost is almost always a few hours of time that could
    be used for other activities. Arrogance comes in because we think we’re
    more important than we are. That our effort is needed so direly by
    society that we can’t afford to play with ants.</p>
    <p>And so a defense of rabbit holes has become a critique of training
    your policy under the objective function of maximal productivity. This
    is perhaps an additional reason why it’s important to volunteer. Because
    committing yourself to something with zero personal gain and nonzero
    cost forces you to rethink whether the heuristic was right in the first
    place.</p>
    <p>Back to research and rabbit holes. Would you willingly undertake a
    research project if you were told that it would inevitably fail? Is
    there still benefit to such a project? Who benefits from that negative
    result? Negative results are indeed useful, but who wants to be the
    sucker to invest years for it? Of course, you can never know what will
    end up a positive result. Maybe that’s what drives every researcher.
    That their hypothesis will bring more meaning to the world.</p>
    <p>Cultivating a curious mindset is important. Not because importance is
    measured by task completions, but because it could be better measured by
    how elevated your base experience of life could become. Being curious is
    so much more exciting.</p>
    <p>Some items I’d like to share with you * Finished playing Portal 2
    since the last blog post. Such a fantastic, genre-defining, (dare I say
    perfect) entry. * Also finished reading Stripe Press edition Poor
    Charlie’s Almanack. Main takeaway: an understanding of nonlinearity is
    king in decision making.</p>
