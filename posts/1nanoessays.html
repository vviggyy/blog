    <h4>7.5.25</h4>
    <p>On America’s 249th birthday, I employed an exorbitant use of free
    will and walked 20 minutes from my apartment to the grocery store to get
    a rotisserie chicken. JUST a rotisserie chicken. In a stunning plot twist, I paired
    this with cheese fries from a Royal Farms just down the road.</p>
    <p>Walking, as Einstein (or some other experienced walker) has said, is
    thoroughly stimulating for the mind. I’ve been thinking about what this
    blog should be. As I mentioned in <a href="0genesis.html">0 Genesis</a> it’s too easy to let
    perfectionism, pseudointellectualism, and other -isms get in the way of
    building a resource that that doesn’t need to be perfect, intellectual
    or whatever else.</p>
    <p>There was some freedom in realizing that this blog could have “posts”
    of any length, any form, on any topic (technical, philosophical,
    shenanigan-focused). It doesn’t even need to be called a blog; that word
    in itself carries baggage.</p>
    <p>Coincidentally, when I was eating the aforementioned cheese fries and
    rotisserie chicken for dinner, a <a
    href="https://youtu.be/hi8meiPUt84?si=kRqUArLJuCtnxyiu">youtube
    video</a> popped up talking about mini essays. I didn’t watch the whole
    thing but it was a humorous callback to my wandering thoughts half an
    hour before. I guess this will be a microessay. Or maybe to escape the
    shackles of labels, let’s not delineate. Who’s to say it’s not a
    nanoessay?</p>

    <p>Some thoughts: 
        <ul>
             <li> Is learning poker by eye the same as learning the
    guitar by ear? </li>
            <li> I just learned of <a href="https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a>. This thing seems magical, how
    did I not know about this earlier? (now I can write these in markdown
    and convert to html without having to use those chevrons) </li>
    <li> * P.s. how
    does homebrew work</li>
        </ul>
